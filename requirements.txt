# Requirements for iptables-graph

# For building standalone executable
pyinstaller>=5.0

# Note: The main script (iptables-graph.py) only uses Python standard library
# modules and has no external dependencies. This requirements.txt is only
# needed for building the executable with PyInstaller.

# System dependencies (not Python packages):
# - graphviz (provides 'dot' binary for format conversion)
#   Install with: apt-get install graphviz (Debian/Ubuntu)
#                 yum install graphviz (RHEL/CentOS)
#                 brew install graphviz (macOS)
