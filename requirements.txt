# Requirements for iptables-graph

# For building standalone executable
pyinstaller>=5.0

# For building and uploading PyPI packages

# Note: The main script only uses Python standard library modules and has no
# external dependencies. This requirements.txt is only needed for building
# the executable with PyInstaller and publishing to PyPI.

# System dependencies (not Python packages):
# - graphviz (provides 'dot' binary for format conversion)
#   Install with: apt-get install graphviz (Debian/Ubuntu)
#                 yum install graphviz (RHEL/CentOS)
